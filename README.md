## This fork: WoW Classic beta 1.60.1.70245 ("Forever")

Branch `forever` runs TrinityCore master against the **WoW Classic beta client 1.60.1.70245** (`_classic_beta_\WowB.exe`)
with a vanilla world (converted from VMaNGOS) and the Skyborne / Zephras Isle content.

**Just want to play?** Use the Windows repack from the releases: extract, run `Setup.bat`, start the servers in the
Forever Launcher, press Play. No MySQL or compiling needed.

**Server architecture and operations:** [Complete bnetserver and worldserver guide](doc/ServerGuide.md) — login flow, databases, networking, setup, administration, backups, and troubleshooting.

### Building from source

Build the core as usual (see [Install](#install)), then:

**1. Databases.** Use TrinityCore's normal auto-setup with `TDB_full_world_1210.26091_2026_09_09.sql` and
`TDB_full_hotfixes_1210.26091_2026_09_09.sql` in the worldserver folder. worldserver then applies all updates and
`sql/custom` files itself (`Updates.EnableDatabases = 15`); nothing else is needed. The vanilla world converted from
VMaNGOS ships as plain SQL (`sql/custom/world/2026_09_27_00_world_forever_baseline_*.sql`, about 65 MB, so the first
start takes a few minutes). The result is identical to the released database.

Already have a database from an older version (including one built with `vmangos_world`)? Just pull and start
worldserver: it applies the new files on top, and `vmangos_world` can be dropped afterwards.

**2. Config.** The Classic client needs these (everything else can stay default):

`worldserver.conf`
```
RealmID = 70                                  # the Classic client only accepts realm 70 (the auth SQL renames realm 1)
Expansion = 0
Network.SkipBuildAuthKeyCheck = 1
Network.EnterEncryptedModeRegionGroup = 8
```
`bnetserver.conf`
```
Realm.CfgContentSetID = 137
LoginREST.ExternalAddress = trinity.actual.battle.net
LoginREST.LocalAddress = trinity.actual.battle.net
CertificatesFile = "./<your cert chain>.pem"  # certificate for trinity.actual.battle.net, see below
PrivateKeyFile = "./<your key>.pem"
```
If worldserver stops right after `Realm running as realm ID 1`, `RealmID` is not 70.

**Game data (maps, vmaps, mmaps).** Run the tools built from this branch in the **World of Warcraft** folder (the one that
holds `.build.info` and `_classic_beta_`). The Forever client is the CASC product **`wow_classic_beta`**; this branch's
extractors use it by default (TrinityCore's own default `wow` = retail fails with "Error opening casc storage / No locales
detected"; on older builds of the tools pass `-p wow_classic_beta`):
```
mapextractor
vmap4extractor
mkdir vmaps
vmap4assembler Buildings vmaps
mmaps_generator
```
Then move `dbc`, `gt`, `maps`, `vmaps` and `mmaps` into the worldserver's `DataDir`.

**3. Login.** The client logs in to `trinity.actual.battle.net` over TLS, so on the client PC:

- hosts file: `127.0.0.1 trinity.actual.battle.net` (or your server's IP)
- a certificate for `trinity.actual.battle.net` signed by a root CA that the client PC trusts. Create your **own** CA
  (restrict it with `nameConstraints = critical,permitted;DNS:actual.battle.net`) and never share its private key.
  The repack's `setup\Setup.ps1` shows the exact openssl commands.
- start the client with the [Forever Launcher](https://github.com/advocaite/foreverlauncher-releases), which sets the portal and
  the server's public key.

## Introduction

TrinityCore is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.

If you wish to contribute ideas or code, please visit our site linked below or
make pull requests to our [Github repository](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/pulls).
